Barcelona, the second biggest city in Spain, is located at a strategic
geographical point on the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian peninsula,
protected by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, delimited by two river
deltas and with privileged natural surrounding. Barcelona is an open, vibrant
and creative city with a busy cultural, political, business and commercial
life. It is a metropolis where every imaginable language can be heard, as well
as a city that invites its residents and visitors alike to discover its culture
and traditions. Strolling around the streets of Barcelona will bring surprises
at every turn. Pedestrian streets in the old quarter, green spaces, and a
splendid seafront with a range of modern facilities are a reflection of its
multi-faceted character.
