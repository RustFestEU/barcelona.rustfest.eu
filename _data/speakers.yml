    Malte is interested in data-centric functional and relational programming.
    His aim is to create simple and effective programs — to unveil technology's inherent beauty.
    Currently, he writes his Master's thesis on online analysis of distributed dataflows with differential computation at ETH Zurich and TU Munich.
    In his software consulting firm Clockworks,
    he uses the same tech stack to explore novel stream processing paradigms.
    And, of course, all implementation is done in Rust!
