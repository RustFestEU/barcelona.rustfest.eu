### 4 days of RustFest

Rustfest 2019 will start on **November 9th (Saturday)** and will end on **November 12th (Tuesday)**.

As usual, this edition will have two first days full of talks and workshops and two additional days (aka Impl Days) where you will be able to get together with other rustaceans, meet in smaller groups and work on your own community projects.

### Mixing things a little bit

Although we are keeping the same length in terms of days we have decided to change things a little bit and try something different.

This year, the conference format will change: we're going to split the days into talks in the morning and workshops in the afternoon on both days.

We took into account the feedback we received from previous editions and we believe this can work well for most of you.
This will allow us to have a less packed schedule and more time for you to enjoy both the talks & the workshops.

### Exact schedule

We will publish an exact schedule, including all talks and workshops, before the conference.
Keep an eye on [our blog](https://blog.rustfest.eu/) for more information.
