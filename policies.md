**Catering and Sustainability**

We’re providing water throughout the day as well as coffee and tea during the breaks. Feel free to bring your own drinking cup / bottle to avoid single-use items, if you have the possibility. Lunch will be served on both days at the venue as well as snacks provided during the short breaks (vegetarian and vegan options available). We are working together with the catering to make sure your dietary requirements are met.

**Code of Conduct and Contact information**

At RustFest we strive to make the conference as accessible, inclusive and save as possible. In order to ensure this, the event takes place under a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), and we follow the PyCon [Attendee](https://us.pycon.org/2018/about/code-of-conduct/attendee-procedure/) and [Staff](https://us.pycon.org/2018/about/code-of-conduct/staff-procedure/) procedure for reporting. If you haven’t read it yet, please do so before the conference. If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a conference organizer or a member of the awareness team (recognizable by their pink t-shirts) as soon as possible. You can find an overview of the organizers on the about page - feel free to approach us at the conference. Additionally, we are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

In case of any emergency or Code of Conduct violation, contact any staff or accessibility team member immediately or contact us via e-mail or phone directly, we are always there for you:

**Scent and smoking policy**

People with multiple chemical sensitivities, asthma, allergies, or other immune problems can experience serious and debilitating physical and neurological symptoms when exposed to the chemicals used in most scented products. Reactions can include sneezing and severe headaches and force people to leave the conference. While we don’t ask attendees to be fragrance-free, we do ask that you avoid wearing significant amounts of fragrance (e.g. don’t wear perfume that day). Keep in mind that laundry detergent, clothes softener, soap, body wash, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, hair products, cologne and perfume may all have fragrances that can affect people with these sensitivities. If someone is wearing a scent that is causing you symptoms, please let a RustFest team member or the awareness team know and we will work with the person wearing it to reduce the scent. Please do not smoke near entryways and other common areas. If you smoke during breaks at the conference, please be sensitive to others and wash your hands after you smoke.

**Pronoun stickers**

This year we will again provide pronoun stickers that non-verbally show by which pronoun people want to be addressed - **they/them**, **she/her**, **he/his** or blank ones for you to write on. By this we can avoid misgendering each other, because you can’t know someone’s pronoun unless they’ve told you. The stickers will be placed on the welcome desk during registration and after - feel free to use them and put them on a visible spot on your clothing or elsewhere.

**Color Communication Badges**

Have you already heard about Color Communication Badges? We will be providing them for the very first time during registration and after. This resource is stemming from the autistic community and allows you to communicate your conversation preferences non-verbally. According to the guideline written by The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN), it works like this:

Showing a **green badge** means that the person is actively seeking communication; they have trouble initiating conversations, but want to be approached by people who are interested in talking.

Showing a **yellow badge** means that the person only wants to talk to people they recognize, not by strangers or people they only know from the Internet. The badge-wearer might approach strangers to talk, and that is okay; the approached people are welcome to talk back to them in that case. But unless you have already met the person face-to-face, you should not approach them to talk.

Showing a **red badge** means that the person probably does not want to talk to anyone, or only wants to talk to a few people. The person might approach others to talk, and that is okay; the approached people are welcome to talk back to them in that case. But unless you have been told already by the badge-wearer that you are on their “red list”, you should not approach them to talk.

**Photography**

On Saturday and Sunday there will be a professional photographer on site who will capture the conference’s best moments. We will have once more two kinds of lanyards: **Black ones** if you are ok with being photographed, and **red ones** if you do not wish so. We will inform the photographer to be considerate of this policy.

**Gender-neutral toilets**

On the main conference days Saturday and Sunday there will be gender-neutral toilets available, which means that everybody can use any of the toilets in the venue. Unfortunately we can’t provide this for the impl days because regular university classes will start again that day and the university policies don’t allow us to.
Apart from this, there will be a selection of toiletries available in the bathrooms for you to use. If toilet paper or soap should run out, or if there should be any other problem with the toilet, please let us know so we can take care of it!

**Quiet room / Nursing room**

There will be a quiet room available that you are welcome to use if you need some quiet space away from the noise.
You can work, think, chill out or nap in the quiet room but please don’t talk to other attendees. You can listen to headphones and you are also welcome to use computers and phones if they have their sound muted and you don’t have a voice conversation through them. If you and someone else in the quiet room want to chat, please leave the room. If others are talking or making noise in the quiet room, and you are comfortable reminding them of the rules, please do so. Otherwise please ask the registration desk for help. The room can also be used for nursing.

**Live transcription**

During the talks there will be a live captioning made visible on the screens, to make it easier for you to follow the speakers.
