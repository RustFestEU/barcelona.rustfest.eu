title: Introduction to Embedded Development

speakers:
  - hanno-braun
  - matthias-endler

desc: >
    Rust is a great choice for embedded development!
    It combines high-level abstractions with low-level control, safety with performance.
    In this workshop, you will learn embedded development on a microcontroller, using Rust.
    We'll teach the basics, talk about pitfalls, and provide an environment for experimentation.

    Experience with embedded development is not required, but basic Rust experience would be helpful.
    Every participant will be provided with a LPC845-BRK development board, free of charge and for them to keep.
