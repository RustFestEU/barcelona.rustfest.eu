title: A Machine Learning introduction to ndarray

speakers:
  - luca-palmieri

desc: |
    The `ndarray` ecosystem provides the basic building blocks to write scientific computing software in Rust:
    we will go through the main features,
    the data ownership model and other fundamental concepts required to properly leverage the strength of this suite of crates.

    Most machine learning techniques, once you get to the nitty gritty implementation details,
    boil down to a bunch of matrix multiplications and linear algebra algorithms, with a sprinkle of statistics.
    We will implement from scratch some machine learning routines as a hands-on introduction to ndarray and its ecosystem.
