title: Life of an async fn

desc: >
    async/await is one of the headline features to ship in Rust this year.
    But how does it actually work, and what does that mean for performance?

    We'll walk through what happens to async/await code inside the compiler.
    We'll see some of the performance implications that result from this, and how to avoid common pitfalls.
    You'll walk away with a deeper understanding of how your async/await code behaves at runtime
    and what the compiler is doing under the hood.

    Finally, we'll explore some of the cutting-edge use cases for async/await and coroutines beyond web servers.
