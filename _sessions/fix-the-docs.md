title: Getting feedbacks/opinions on rustdoc and Rust documentation

desc: |
    This workshop tries to gather feedback and opinions on what people would like to have changed/improved/added in rustdoc
    and Rust documentation more generally, but also discussing about some old (and "famous") issues to get some new insights.

    Furthermore, this can be used as a discussion ground about good practices when writing Rust documentation
    and present some useful but not very well known rustdoc features.

    The idea behind it is trying to be able to connect to documentation users as well as writers and try to hear their needs in person.
