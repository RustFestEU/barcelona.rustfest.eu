    **2-day workshop**
    <br>
    RustBridge is an all-day workshop focused on getting underrepresented people
    with a background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the community.
    In this workshop weâ€™ll get you up and running with a Rust development environment,
    introduce you to Rust syntax and programming concepts, and work together to build a small website that you can personalize,
     extend, and share!
