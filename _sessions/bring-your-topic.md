title: "Bring your own topic / Lightning talks"
desc: |
    An ad-hoc space to present and discuss your latest research and experiments with Rust.

    What are you working on?
    What's your crate of the month?
    Any RFC that's noteworthy?
    A new cool design pattern you recently learned and applied in your own codebase?

    You are encouraged to bring a lightning talk, a discussion started or your code problem.
    All attendees will be invited to both ask for a topic to be covered, and present on any topic of interest to the group.
    Participation is voluntary, of course.
