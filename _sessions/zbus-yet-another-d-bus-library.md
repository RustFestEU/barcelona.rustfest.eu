title: "zbus: Yet another D-Bus library"

desc: >
    In this talk, I will present zbus, a D-Bus crate written from scratch. D-Bus is an inter-process communication mechanism, available and used on almost all modern Linux desktops and many embedded systems. I will start with why I felt the need to take this huge undertaking on my shoulders, followed by the design goals, the challenges faced and how I overcame them during the development.
