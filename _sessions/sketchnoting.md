title: Sketching for faster learning and effective communication
desc: |
    Ever seen sketchnotes at a conference, and wished you could communicate as clearly, and quickly?

    We’ll let you in on a secret - drawing is a teachable skill, just like writing code is.

    We’ll start this workshop with introductory exercises we’ve refined at conference workshops this year,
    to help you build some confidence.

    Next we’ll show you how you can use these techniques to help with discussions around system design and software architecture,
    summarise subjects you’re learning, or capture the key ideas from talks.

    You’ll leave with new confidence and skills you can use the same day!
