title: "Wundergraph or How to build a compile time GraphQL ORM"

desc: >
    The rust ecosystem is missing a performant crate to serve GraphQL APIs generated from existing database schemes.
    Wundergraph fills this niche by utilizing Diesel
    and Juniper to provide a performant way to serve a database schema as a GraphQL API.

    In this workshop we explore how to build abstractions above strongly typed crates,
    and discover some more exotic parts of the type system.
    We do this by talking through many examples.

    If you like to see advanced uses of Rust's trait system,
    or if you're interested in how we managed to write a high-performance GraphQL server library, this workshop is for you.
