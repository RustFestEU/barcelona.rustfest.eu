title: "Wundergraph or How to build a compile time GraphQL ORM using Diesel"

desc: |
    The rust ecosystem is missing a performant crate to serve GraphQL APIs generated from existing database schemes.
    Wundergraph fills this niche by utilizing Diesel and Juniper to provide a performant way to serve a database schema as a
    GraphQL API.

    As part of this workshop we will

    * explore basic Diesel usage
    * learn how Diesel works internally
    * look into basic Wundergraph usage
    * and learn how to build complex abstractions like Wundergraph

    Each step will be augmented with practical hands-on coding exercises.

    If you like to see advanced uses of Rust's trait system,
    or if you're interested in how we managed to write a high-performance GraphQL server library, this workshop is for you.
