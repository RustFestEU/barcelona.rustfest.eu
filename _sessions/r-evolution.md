title: "R-Evolution: A Story of Rust Adoption"
special: Keynote
desc: >
  The software industry has a billion dollar problem.
  Our underlying systems are built on a mountain of insecure technologies that make it next to impossible to write secure software.
  There are an innumerable amount of cases where Rust could have prevented serious security issues that not only had a deep impact on companies but more importantly on people.
  <br>
  <br>
  But the path to wider adoption of Rust across industry is filled with many challenges not only for companies but for the Rust community itself.
  What does this journey to industry-wide adoption look like? How can we all work together to make sure that as more companies start adopting Rust, the language gets even better?
