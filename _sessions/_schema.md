   We were on the track ahead as the nightmare plastic column of foetid black iridescence
   oozed tightly onward through its fifteen-foot sinus; gathering unholy speed and driving
   before it a spiral, re-thickening cloud of the pallid abyss-vapour. It was a terrible,
   indescribable thing vaster than any subway train â€” a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic
   bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming
   as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us,
   crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its
   kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.
