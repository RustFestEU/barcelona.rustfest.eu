title: Amp Up Web Audio Applications with Rust and WebAssembly

desc: >
    With the advent of the Web Audio API, creating browser-based audio applications became reality,
    potentially making creative applications available to a wider audience.
    There's just one problem: writing real-time digital sound processing code in a garbage-collected language isn't all that easy.
    A systems programming language like Rust, on the other hand, is perfectly suited for that task.
    Cue WebAssembly!
    Thanks to Rust's convenient tooling, efficient DSP applications for the web browser can now easily be created,
    helping to make creative tools available on every platform.
