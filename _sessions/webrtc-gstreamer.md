title: WebRTC with GStreamer and Tokio

desc: |
    In this workshop we will develop a small command-line application that acts as a WebRTC peer
    and can share audio/video streams with a web browser or another instance of the application.

    Technology-wise we'll use GStreamer for the multimedia aspects
    and Tokio/websocket for the networking aspects, and we'll make use of async/await.

    Basic Rust knowledge is a requirement for this workshop
    and participants should bring a laptop (ideally with webcam/mic), running Linux, macOS or Windows, or pair with another participant on their laptop.
