    Creative coding is a way of looking at programming as a tool for creative expression.
    One of the beauties of creative coding is the potential to express ourselves in a wide variety of domains.
    Nannou aims to give equal priority and easy access to a full suite of creative I/O including graphics, multi-windowing, audio, LASERs, lighting and more.

    Attendees will get an introduction to creative coding through nannou
    and the opportunity to use nannou to experiment with each of the aforementioned domains in a guided, relaxed and playful setting.
