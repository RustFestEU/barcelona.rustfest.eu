title: Powering Crowd-sourcing of Public Transit Delays with Rust

desc: >
    "Your train is arriving in between 20 to 90 minutes".
    This is a reality for about 3 million train commuters in South Africa,
    who not only battle to commute daily,
    but are faced with a lack of accurate information and high uncertainty about their trains.

    This talk explores how we progressively use Rust to power crowd-sourcing of train delays,
    and are helping reduce the uncertainty of arrival times in our ailing train (and bus) services;
    all with little computing resources.

    We focus on how the Rust language and ecosystem helps us to create tools and services that run at scale and low cost.
