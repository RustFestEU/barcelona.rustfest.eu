title: "Lindenmayer systems; modeling the natural world"

desc: >
    Nature has beautiful forms: from the crescent waves on the ocean to the beautiful wings of certain butterflies;
    from the stripes and spots of animals to the branching and weaving of plants and trees.
    All these patterns seem intricate and complex.
    Often they can be modeled in a simple and effective way.
    Sometimes this model lets you learn something about nature.

    In this workshop, we will explore Lindenmayer systems, or L-systems.
    These systems allow you to model various natural forms such as plants and it offers a playground for certain type of fractals.
    So let's explore your favorite natural forms.
