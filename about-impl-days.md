## about:impl_days

"impl Days" is the sibling event of RustFest Barcelona.
"impl Days" is a two full-day event for Rust contributors to collaborate in an active programming session.
They will take place on the two days following the RustFest talks and workshops, on {{site.dates.impl_days_no_br}} {{site.dates.year}} at **[{{site.location.venue}}](/location/#venue)**.

Exact times will be posted in advance to the conference.

## What to hack on

During the "impl Days" we will keep a live document with projects & teams.
Check back here during the "impl Days".

## History

Born as a hacking and development experiment in the early RustFest editions, the "impl Days" have established as a
tradition following each RustFest.

The name refers to the first edition that took place during the 2017 "impl Period", therefore the name "impl Days" was a
natural choice. <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/the-impl-period-newsletter-2/6034">Over those two days</a>,
30 to 40 people came together to discuss, design, and implement changes to Rust itself as well its broader ecosystem.

Plus, <a href="https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-internals/2017-10-02/?msg=91818378&page=2">they got to build a Lego Death
Star</a>.

The Zurich "impl Days" were such a success that we decided to repeat the event in Paris and it was an even <a

## `impl Days` Barcelona

"impl Days" will be hosted at the same venue as the main conference: {{site.location.venue}}.

"impl Days" are a great chance to work directly with other Rust enthusiasts. The Rust project is supported by volunteers
across the globe, and while we often rely on github comments and IRC channels for communication, face-to-face
communication enabled by an event like this can be a big productivity boost.

You may be just starting out as a Rust contributor, or you may be a long-time compiler hacker who reminisces about the
days when Rust was bootstrapped atop ML. Either way, there's plenty of tasks for all contributors at "impl Days".

You do not need to buy a separate ticket: your RustFest ticket will suffice.

Thus, everyone who plans to attend "impl Days" should tell us explicitly on the online questionnaire built into the
RustFest ticket.

## What will happen at the "impl Days"?

The schedule will be announced closer to the event, when details are finalized.

The general idea is to arrive at the location in the morning, then there will be a headcount and some time spent getting
to know each other, finally identify tasks for participants to collaborate on.
Each of the two days will start winding down in the afternoon.
Further details will be finalized at a later stage.

* People can freely work on their own with headphones on or form little groups.
* Participants are free to arrive later and depart earlier than the schedule specified above.
* Like in past editions, participants are of course free to leave to enjoy the city for a nice walk along the beach or other attractions Barcelona has to offer.

Lacking ideas or suggestions for projects to work on? No problem!

* "good first issue" is a popular label for many Rust core repositories, ancillary tooling and crates as well - some examples: [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue) or have a look [here](https://www.rustaceans.org/findwork/starters) and [here](https://github.com/RustBeginners/please/issues).
* Issues triaging
* Documentation: many crates are in need of a bare `README.md` or some usage examples in the `examples` directory.

Most of all participants should enjoy "impl Days" without any pressure or accomplishment requirement. If your final result is a better understanding of the Rust world and having met some cool folks to keep in touch with, well - that's a fantastic result as well! ðŸŽŠ

More detailed planning will be done on-the-fly at the event itself, based on the skill sets of the people showing
up to contribute.
